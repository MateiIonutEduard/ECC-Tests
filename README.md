## Description

This application provides a testing system for algebraic operations on points of an elliptic curve given in <br/> projective forms: Jacobian, Jacobian-Chudnovsky, and the modified Jacobian representation introduced by <br/>Cohen et al.
It aims to measure the efficiency of scalar multiplication of projective points using mixed coordinates on Weierstrass curves.<br/>
